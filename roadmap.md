# Project: AI Academic Paper Search Agent

This repository contains the roadmap and development for an AI agent designed to search for and retrieve relevant academic research papers based on a user-provided topic.

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective is to build an efficient agent that accepts a text query and returns a curated, relevant list of academic papers, extracting key information such as title, authors, abstract, and a direct link.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

This roadmap is divided into phases, from initial planning to deployment and future enhancements.

### Phase 0: Definition & Planning (Week 1)

*   [ ] **Define Objectives & Scope:**
    *   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Accept a simple text query, search 1-2 APIs (e.g., arXiv, Semantic Scholar), and return a basic list of papers.
    *   **Future Features:** Support natural language, automatic summaries, advanced filtering (by citation count, date), and a GUI.
*   [ ] **Select Technology Stack:**
    *   **Language:** Python
    *   **Agent Framework:** LangChain / LlamaIndex
    *   **LLM:** OpenAI (GPT series), Cohere, or Open Source models (Llama 3, Mixtral)
    *   **Academic APIs:** Semantic Scholar, arXiv, PubMed, etc.
*   [ ] **Initial Planning:**
    *   Define milestones and timeline.
    *   Set up the Git/GitHub repository.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Prototyping (Weeks 2-3)

*   [ ] **Set Up Development Environment:**
    *   Install Python and dependencies (`requests`, `langchain`, `jupyter`).
    *   Manage API keys securely.
*   [ ] **Create a Notebook Prototype:**
    *   [ ] Connect to an LLM's API.
    *   [ ] Make a successful call to an academic API (e.g., `arXiv`).
    *   [ ] Parse and display the data from the retrieved papers.
    *   [ ] Validate the core workflow's feasibility.

### Phase 2: Core Agent Development (Weeks 4-6)

*   [ ] **Design Agent Architecture:**
    *   **Query Processing Module:** Refine user input using an LLM to extract keywords.
    *   **Search & Retrieval Module:** Interact with multiple APIs and unify the results.
    *   **Ranking & Filtering Module:** Sort results by relevance, date, or citations.
*   [ ] **Implement Flow with LangChain/LlamaIndex:**
    *   Build the chain that orchestrates the modules.
    *   Design and implement prompts to guide the LLM for each task.
*   [ ] **Implement Error Handling:**
    *   Add logic to manage unavailable APIs, empty results, or LLM errors.

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Weeks 7-8)

*   [ ] **Unit Testing:**
    *   Create tests for each module in isolation.
*   [ ] **Integration Testing:**
    *   Test the agent's end-to-end flow with a variety of queries.
    *   Verify the consistency and relevance of the output.
*   [ ] **Quality Evaluation & Tuning:**
    *   Manually evaluate the quality of results for a sample set of topics.
    *   Tune prompts and ranking logic to improve accuracy.

### Phase 4: Interface Creation (Weeks 9-10)

*   [ ] **Select Interface Type:**
    *   **Option A (CLI):** Create a command-line interface using `argparse` or `click`.
    *   **Option B (Web UI):** Develop a simple web interface with `Streamlit` or `Gradio` for a quick and effective demo.
*   [ ] **Develop the Interface:**
    *   Build the chosen interface and connect it to the agent's core logic.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation (Week 11)

*   [ ] **Prepare for Deployment:**
    *   Package the project for easy installation (`pyproject.toml`).
    *   Containerize the application (e.g., with Docker) for web deployment.
*   [ ] **Deploy the Application:**
    *   Publish the package to PyPI (for a CLI).
    *   Deploy the web app to a platform like Vercel, Google Cloud Run, or Heroku.
*   [ ] **Write Final Documentation:**
    *   Complete this `README.md` with installation and usage instructions.
    *   Add code documentation (docstrings).
    *   Create a simple user guide.

### Phase 6: Maintenance & Evolution (Ongoing)

*   [ ] **Monitoring & Feedback:**
    *   Keep an eye on API usage and associated costs.
    *   Collect and act on user feedback.
*   [ ] **Iterative Development:**
    *   Implement features from the "Future Features" list.
    *   Keep dependencies up to date.
    *   Experiment with new LLMs and academic APIs.
